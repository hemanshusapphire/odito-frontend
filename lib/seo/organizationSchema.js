/**
 * Canonical Organization + WebSite JSON-LD for oditoai.com — a single,
 * stable entity (@id: `${siteConfig.url}/#organization`) that every page
 * shares, rather than a separate Organization object per page. Rendered
 * site-wide from the true root layout (app/layout.js) via <JsonLd/>, so
 * this is the ONLY place Organization/WebSite data is defined; do not
 * create a second one elsewhere.
 *
 * Odito is a SaaS platform, not a physically-visited local business — this
 * is deliberately "Organization", never "LocalBusiness". LocalBusiness
 * requires real address/telephone/geo/openingHours data, none of which
 * exists anywhere in this codebase; fabricating it to satisfy an SEO audit
 * would be worse than the "missing schema" issue it's meant to fix.
 *
 * Every field below is sourced from data that already exists in the
 * project (siteConfig, the real logo file in /public) except `sameAs`,
 * which is TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER data — see the loud comment on that field.
